## Assignment – Alternative 1, Portfolio

- [ ] Build a (new-isch) Portfolio site using Next. You can reuse a lot of code from the old one you made in the previous course as well as the design you used in the previous course. Or you can make a new (simpler) one.
- [ ] There should, at least, be a portfolio page and an about page with different routes.
- [ ] Link to all the sites and GitHub projects you've made in this course so far

  - [ ] From Week 02: Link to the GitHub repo for Week 2.
  - [ ] From Week 03: Link to the published site and GitHub repo
  - [ ] From Week 04: Link to the published site and GitHub repo
  - [ ] From Week 05, this week: Link to site (¯\_(ツ)_/¯) and GitHub repo
- [ ] Make sure to provide some kind of image that reflect the work you've done each week.
    - [ ] Either a snippet or a scaled down image of a site.
    - [ ] For week 1 and 2, the image can be of how it looks in the terminal when you run your program or how the generated HTML page looks like.
- [ ] BONUS: Add a custom 404 page (check https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75302340/not-found-page-does-not-work-in-next-js-13/75625136#75625136 for an example).
